OLDER SCHEME: OUT1,2,3 from Cvs (jacks in) MIXED to IN (single)\n\nmix=buffered finger padIN, finger DAC/voltage divider, 3xfingeredVCA from each OUT (freeze/unfreeze) and maybe recording and playback of DACs\n\nmicro for logic of freeze/unfreeze and 3x DAC (or 9 for 3x of these)
Text Notes 1040 1925 0    79   ~ 0
NEWER SCHEME: Just a 4x4 grid so we need 4x mixers for 4x signals from VCAs - no buffered pads.
