* TODO for production

- finals software: re-acquaint with modes
- +check proto+ - all checked out fine but decide on filter resistors
- BOM and quote/production - check on imac which version we have


* production notes

board is Board Size (width) 	101.2 mm 	Board Size (height) 	106.2 mm 

ordered new prototype - testing 9/9/2020

all_colours_pcb30062020

match up new bom with allcolours_in_progress.xls

leave off resistors: noise high: R19 noise low: R12

* code/etc check parts

** 5/6/2020

- we changed interpol in mode 32 so is every x bits - do this for all or keep different programs?

(to do this also for unweighted DAC modes 48->58 - test in 48 -> revert back to no timing here as is smoother

- speed control by DAC is now as mode 0 and placed inside speed loop on both sides_ TEST if IN or OUT!?
- fixed smoothing which was missing mode 0

- program different DACs across DAC modes - so some with different ranges and some with speeds

// so we have on each side: 

0-15 -CV NO DAC
16-31 -pulse NO DAC

//DACS:
32-48 -CV and DAC -> interpol options (how many bits to wait if any, all modes now have basic waiting) and different ranges in either case

49-57 -pulse and unweighted DAC - different ranges, 8, 16 or 32 bits, weighted DAC in some cases 

58-63 -pulse and other DACS

PWMH: 4.4
PWML: 4.4
noiseL: 4
noiseH: 6 
compLC: 4.6
compHC: 4.6
compLA: 4.4
compHA: 4.4
filter outH: 7 - *R102 to 6.8k gives us now 5v*
filter outL: 5 - *R61*  but can go up to 7 too - maybe leave both at 10k or compromise to 8.2k

pulse outH: 5.6
pulse outL: 5.8

(Adjust noise for 5Vpp -> R19l and R12h)

- all hardware tested and working fine...
