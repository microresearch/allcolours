** pyro module for 4 triggers

- 4 pulse inputs
- 4 sets of terminals for triggers (from FETs)
- switch on encoder arms the device
- how to show is armed - some display/LED/nicer? but cutout to show this/surface mount - or like 4 bright leds with slit// to test?
- UV light would be nice
- different modes eg. single trigger sets off all, at interval x... next on x does x... enables/etc
- power socket as in breath - but widen the pins for segor socket

** started july 20

- schematic started
- tested encoder: PEC11R-4215F-S0024

- sizes and selection for clamps?
