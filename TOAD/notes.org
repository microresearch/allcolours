* schematic

In progress - from previous filter design but now merge of SIGNUM
chaos, WASP 4069 filter with extra integrator, and bintic switched
cap filter:

To note for new schematic:

- +12v and GND only throughout except first and last stage
- maybe add OTA/CVA on input too
- OTA control of b1/bb1 - b2/bb2 and b3/bb3 is all from same CV - one knob/cv
- OTA control of VCA in, damping?? and SIGNUM feedback is all CV - so 2 or 3 more knob/CV

- all 4069 are seperate to avoid heating - do we need to GND extra pins? no

- TEST: WASP feedback with diodes ->

- On breadboard is from where damping would be //2nd stage// - we just have 100k and
  pot at moment - test with wasp feedback - tested and works well but
  we can't put under voltage control

- Original damping option with 22k (or otherwise) to GND and OTA feedback...

- test LM13700, test other SIGNUM option.


- prototype PCB with all stages pluggable, NLC-style SIGNUM also patchable and invert/non-inv input options for each OTA  

- note that in HAIBLE/DUAL WASP there is 1k in parallel with 10k LIN pot and 1k and diode at bottom of pot - this is to turn into log pot?
