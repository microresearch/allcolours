- if we think of a simple switching analogue comp - with several 4066
  switch points which can be switched by hand (a switch, touch/toggle)
  or by CV->comparator

what voltage can 4066 handle/what is its max power? as on touch toggle
we use +-9v to power - i think is 18v so we need to design around this

TOAD test/configurations: bottom ad633 needs replacing,
sigma-delta-comparator is wrong way round for data return so only
works with invQ - but why doesnâ€™t work with high freq AC signal - as
need to raise gnd from clk comparator as in bintic comp...  bintic to
test still, vca to test fully-works

- we change r68 for x-signum(x) as the signum is very high (-12 to +12v) so we have 1M for the moment and looks better

- we need to test bintic with VCA

sort of works in odd ways but ok with simple set up with 2x switched caps and damping in signum/or inversion

TODO from above/notes: swop sigma-delt comp +- for data return, fix clock comparator in there/test on breadboard maybe

** //////

In progress - from previous filter design but now merge of SIGNUM
chaos, WASP 4069 filter with extra integrator, and bintic switched
cap filter:

To note for new schematic:

- +12v and GND only throughout except first and last stage
- maybe add OTA/VCA on input too
- OTA control of b1/bb1 - b2/bb2 and b3/bb3 is all from same CV - one knob/cv

- OTA control of VCA in, damping?? and SIGNUM feedback is all CV - so 2 or 3 more knob/CV

- all 4069 are seperate to avoid heating - do we need to GND extra pins? no

- TEST: WASP feedback with diodes ->

- On breadboard is from where damping would be //2nd stage// - we just have 100k and
  pot at moment - test with wasp feedback - tested and works well but
  we can't put under voltage control

- Original damping option with 22k (or otherwise) to GND and OTA
  feedback (on sprott that was inverting then into inverting in so we
  test it non-inverting ??) TEST

- test LM13700 with extra op-amp (we tried this for first stage B1/BB1 and seems to work but then we need to go inv and inv - TEST for all


- prototype PCB with all stages pluggable, NLC-style SIGNUM also patchable and invert/non-inv input options for each OTA  

- note that in HAIBLE/DUAL WASP there is 1k in parallel with 10k LIN pot and 1k and diode at bottom of pot - this is to turn into log pot?

- in sprott what we have for last SIGNUM feedback stage is x-signum(x) which is same as in Sprott paper "A new class of chaotic circuit"

G(x)=Bx-Csgn(x) which plugs into x``` + Ax`` + x` = G(x)

x``` + Ax`` + x` = Bx-Csgn(x)

so: x``` + Ax`` + x` - [Bx-Csgn(x)] = 0

which is close to:

sprott manual is ax``` + bx`` + [cSGN(x) - dx] = 0

where is x` ???

* TODO

- front vca or not? TESTED and gets complicated...

so we have 3 mid stages controlled by one CV, damping-CV, SIGNUM CV = 3xCV so maybe


- 47k for ota stages

- test different feedback options for damping/first feedback loop:
  tested 51k to GND and straight 13700 through (+) and this works
  fine: maybe leave WASP feedback as an option on test pcb

- test all feedthrough 13700 with extra op amp and inv/inv setup - so 2 extra to do - seems to work out also but values will need to be tweaked

- test extra op-amp on signum but then we reverse the OTA! - tested but not sure - so leave as is...

- maybe leave out alt signum
