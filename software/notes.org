- CV in incoming bit or set of bits to shift and/or value for clock out, CV pulse in to lock/unlock, slew for clock out/cv in, extra as speed of shifting?

- pulse in to shift... purpose of shifting ...
- larger speed shifts for filter are important so maybe look at dividers and changing these with CV
- knob mode for leak etc

start to list modes

1-> various shift register implementations in pulse/bit and speed as
speed/skew CV/knob - OUT is pulse/bit and/or DAC out and OUT is 7490
clock/PWM OUT from shift reg taps ...

2-> various shift register implementations in as pulse/bit (from CV -
threshold) and speed as speed/skew CV/knob - OUT is pulse/bit and/or
DAC out and in CV controls 7490 clock/PWM OUT and is skewed by
speed/skew CV/knob

3-> various shift register implementations in pulse/bit and speed as
speed/skew CV/knob - OUT is pulse/bit and/or DAC out and in pulse
controls 7490 clock/PWM out

other modes?

we can xor and other ops CV and shift reg/pulse/DAC to 7490 CLOCK
