* TOAD filter

- swop round potsDONE
- need amp after each LM13700 stage apart from feedback on ???
- adding resistor to keep 13700 open (except in damping which can go to zero)

- resistors in feedback might change

design and prototype - note from 2k=1.6v (1k into op amp as lower of divider) to 100k = 50mV

- simulated as working for control/LM13700 to TEST!
