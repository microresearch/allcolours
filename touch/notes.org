- 

- speed code is re-written also now with logspeed to try out...

TODO: trial with all caps replaced for bleedthrough etc - 1NF DONE

still bleedthrough but is that anything to do with caps... (see how small we can go with c9 - 100pF?)

TODO:

different fingers for vca, 

also if we can change vca so opens a bit more: values there R52 was adjusted from 47k to 10K maybe trial other values

20k now we have and seems ok

15/12/2021:

- need to add overlap flag for rec and playback...DONE

- problems with speeds and aliasing so need to rewrite code without 32 steps

- try without the 32x slowdown for record (and speed will skip samples)

so we need 8x say upwards of 1KHz which is 8KHz in main loop

we have:

  // 1024/4 is 8x 862Hz (toggle speed so 2x that which is fine for us but we need to lower the sample/hold cap...

replaced c9 with 1NF (from 47NF)

1.6k=4 seconds..

- CV out peaks at 6v - 6.6v is our maxium for 4095

- VCA 4.24 VPP for 5v signal (4.6v is 4095 as I guess we close the VCA a bit) but we can only get to 4.2v on first VCA

- aliasing always - we need to re-think all speeds as DAC can only run up to 100 Hz

/// reduce capacitor in sample/hold from 47nF


+input filter is 15nF and 15k so gives cutoff of 700Hz x2=1.4KHz which is fine+

but rec is 32 times slower and each dac is x8 so that is 32x8=256

in theory is then 8KHz / 256 = 31Hz so aliasing

- so we make everything run faster but really need to resolve all and be very precise of speeds (filters in recording)

- what do we need to get to 1KHz - 256KHz clock

what is max recording again? if say we record at 1 KHz - 7000 samples is 7 seconds...

// need to check we run fast enough for that clock, alternative would be to software filter for recordings
