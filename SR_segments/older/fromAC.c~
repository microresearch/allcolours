//- start porting SRs - more generic from AC!

// just to place here:

/*
Turing Machine: cycle bit is noise vs. comp less than 1, otherwise invert cycling bit

Rungler: XOR out of SR with input bit [in benjolin the DAC out effects some parameter of both clock and data] eg. DAC effects speed/clock of SR

Wiard noise ring: noise/comp selects new input or loop back/inverted loop back (jumper)

CGS(gated comparator - cgs313): This new "digital" input is OR gated with the original "analog" input,

Electronotes wheel thing: LFSR SR bit is loaded/not loaded onto recycling SR. loading can be random (based on LFSR and set of probability switches)
Others: 

Triadex Muse: set parity switches - sequences incoming to 31 bit SR
