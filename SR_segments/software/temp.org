23 trigger bumps on default route but can be routing table // - mods also to prob modes as trigger
trigger could also change logops table for pulses in

24 trigger changes binary routing table - but these here are route[w] and not global routes
25 binary routes - intmode
26 SR as route
27 4 bit shuffle - match with ADC mode 16 - special mode
28 4 bit shuffle with feedback - again matches 16 (but how?) - special mode?

38 pass through or cycle toggled by trigger - can also be for adc, toggle entry or pass (0)... check in adc? ADD to ADC!

4 strobe freezes length of incoming
