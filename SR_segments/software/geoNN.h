// NN new N top ADC:

/*

NN: not so much about speeds. abstract/adc prob of entry/switch

- do we have abstract modes instead of adc in also? could also have prob of adc or abstract. what is default abstract? what is default adc type, adc parameter?
- no route in, just ADC or abstract types
- prob of adc vs. route // adc vs. adc^route - negotiate all probs


////

older notes from geoN.h:

adc, abstracts and routes only

prob of ADC entry or route entry, route XOR ADC

switches between these entries, abstracts as entry (no ADC)?

// TODO: we need different DAC from dacfrom as DAC for ADC input eg. dacIN

ADCin=gate[dacIN[daccount][w]].dac; // test
