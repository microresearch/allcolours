/*

// for new geomantic abstraction: start again again with generics - this one for binroutes
//     [need better labelling scheme]

- for speeds/bits - return bits - for adc=bits: can be adc, dac (as input with adc style processing), or bits as for speed/bits - make more generic

- for length: return length/0-31 - could plug in other functions
// so length as seperate or as a re-processor...

merge all bits for speeds, for adc

how to label/categorise: 

- deal with a route
- abstract bit routines
- process a value
- deal with adc
- deal with dac but:

could we even abstract out further so adc/13 is depth input - but also look at adcs
and function is a processor of these to return bits
