** TODO

- match up binroutes, spdroutes and dacfroms so they make sense
- for extraction be sure to exclude template modes and clean up commented outs, label modes in comments, mark and seperate strobe and other modes

- USE headc macro for modec speed/no freeze in basis.h

- check we are calling correct outv so there is a dac out!

- check logspeed, logspeedd vs. slowerlog etc...

- start to extract and order list of modes so we can test these, how to arrive at groups of modes, easier naming and need to specify modeC modes

list modes per SR: cvspeed, strobe, dacspeed

** from segmodes
