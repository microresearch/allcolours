** schematic 

pulses/ADC for CV/amps. in and out.

- 6 bits ADC in (what is switched voltage in?) level pot also for input
- X bits DAC out from STM as this gives us more configuration but we still need to amp and buffer

- 4 shift registers: noise (top), left and right, overlay (lower) with mode(knob only), speed, length (with cv both), 
- left and right have clock/pulse and pulse in, 2 outs/divided one
- noise and overlay have clock in, 2 outs

total pulses: 6 in + ADC, 8 out

- ADC/noise in mode for noise, DAC/out mode for overlay

or just 2 SR with each own ADC, DAC and overlay...???

- how drop or walk-ins could work with each?

- DAC is now from the STM32F446 as in TOUCH - we copy micro.sch across

but we keep ADC as analogue 6 bits in
