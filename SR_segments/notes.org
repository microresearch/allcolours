** schematic 

- 6 bits ADC in (what is switched voltage in?) level pot also for input
- 6 bits DAC out

- 4 shift registers: noise (top), left and right, overlay (lower) with mode(knob only), speed, length (with cv both), 
- left and right have clock/pulse and pulse in, 2 outs/divided one
- noise and overlay have clock in, 2 outs

total pulses: 6 in + ADC, 8 out + DAC

- ADC/noise in mode for noise, DAC/out mode for overlay

or just 2 SR with each own ADC, DAC and overlay...???

- how drop or walk-ins could work with each?
