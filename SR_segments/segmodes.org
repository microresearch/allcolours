- AC has 64 modes so 64x64x64x64=16 million combinations
- speed CV to use in trigger mode (eg. length of overlap)
- divide into speedCV, trigger/pulse
- see also AC modes.org!
- parallel bits input modes - eg. all x ADC bits are thrown into top or other SR

* NSR, LSR, RSR, CSR

** NSR - top register:

- noise/ADC in -LSR/or/RSR or both 
- types of ADC, length in bits
- can also be clocked by CSR and/or ghosted noise SR 

** LSR/RSR - regular shift register modes borrow from AC

- how we handle entry and overlap from NSR (logical ops, length of overlap)
- can also be clocked by bits from the NSR top register
- also micro registers in SR

** CSR - output register

- type of DAC (eg. sigma/delta which is low pass of x bits)
