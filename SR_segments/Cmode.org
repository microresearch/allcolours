* MODEC

output/dacs, again can be mixes,,,

*some dac out with NO interpol modes eg. c0nov*

for dac out we don't have speed to freeze/no OUT!

question is of length but now as we feedback through NSR is ok...

** older from modec.h

// lowest modes as functions.... DAC output

//*DONEre-check strobey, NOpulsins, pulsouts for all modeX.h modes and count=0 where necessary in modeR


latest notes:

CV:
0-15 basic dac outs
16-31 detachment

CV+DAC:
32-47

INTMODES:
cv as param 
cv as choice of dac



arrange also a bit better in adcetc with order and strobes in

CVmodes: 16xDAC could be reduced, followed by 4x4 DAC modes below, XOR/OR in to test, speeds << >>

DACmodes: 16 - 4x4 as above or???

INTmodes: 16 - CV as param

other ideas: other dac outs, mix of dac outs, add dacs, modulo

// TODO: we need to focus on what length does and cut down number of DAC modes...
// in draftdec.c 16DAC followed by
// 4x4 DAC modes
  /*
1-cycle and route 16 below
2-2x strobe=prob from below
3
4-4 bit shuffle
  
00 1-TM invert cycling bit - OR with BITIN (OR (routed^pulse)) // OR (routedORpulse) ??
01 2-BITIN or loopback
   [10 3-INV of above]
11 4- BITIN or not into cycling

what are the next 16x LR modes

// other possibles: bigger shifts in, speed bumps
