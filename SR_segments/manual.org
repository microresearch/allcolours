** basic blurb description: 

Caput draconis (CD) is/will be the latest ourorack ... companion
extending the ouroboric becoming-noise of the contemporary eurorack
rosarium

Caput draconis (CD) is the latest ourorack (ouroboric) module for
gnarlular processing, and advanced cross frequency CV and audio
pattern generation, encoding a series of successively pleasurable and
tortuous sliding dislocations

intended as lonely serpent's head or as companion for All the Colours
of the Noise extending the ouroboric becoming-noise of the
contemporary eurorack rosarium

Four draconic shift registers are enchained, interlocked, woven and
segmented, recursively feeding on each other in turn, vomiting noise
and wormy symphonies. moon phases and nodal paths. It is to have done
with the judgement of gods.

CD can be considerd as 64^4 different instruments depending on modal
configuration informed by lunar phases and astrogeomantic time signatures.

//Successive Slidings of Pleasure (French: Glissements progressifs du plaisir) RG

extends the pulse driven shift register schemes of All
Colours with 4 and more interlocking shift registers or "runglers"
(each with 64 modes of operation) running at all different speeds. The
emphasis is on complex CV generation and processing of analogue
signals, as well as clock and pulse outputs. Release date March 2023.

theory of operation:

generic: 4 interlocked (software) shift registers, with configurable
routing, speed and length. each has CV control, an adjustable mode,
and clock or pulse inputs. All is bits, 1s and 0s but analogue signals
can be input and can be generated using combinations of these bits.

hardware in detail:

Each side has 3 knobs and 2 CV inputs, and a clock or pulse input. The
central knob on each side controls the mode for that SR, the first
knob (left to right, up to down) is X, the third is Y. In the first 32
modes on each side, and other modes depending on mode, the X control
(CV and knob) controls speed. In modes 33-48 speed is set by the clock
input. In these cases, and in other modes which use the clock for sync
or triggering a condition, clock input is normed to an artificial
clock signal internally generated. Otherwise the clock is left free
and can be used as a regular pulse input. Left and right SRs both have
a pulse input which is simply XORed into the SR; it can be use to mix
new signals into each SR. Left, right and lower SRs each have two
different pulse outputs directly from their own SR bits. 

The top SR has an audio input, the bottom SR has an audio
output. Different input and output encodings can be chosen using the
first mode [0] in the case of top and bottom SRs. In some cases on
mode 0 for the top, audio entry SR, internal signals are generated
(noise, oscillation). In the case where no audio signal is plugged in
physically, the output signal from the 2nd output SR is normed to the
input for feedback. Note that feedback can wail or die!

serpent as blackbox:

Each of the four SRs has internally length, speed, incoming route,
function and type of interlock with incoming SRs. Speed can be set and
manipulated by the X (CV/knob) parameter, output from other SRs
(feedback and rungling), or by the clock input depending one of 64
different modes.

Length, route, interlock and function are also set and configured
within the modes. Moving quickly across modes does not result in
setting intermediate values. Length is the length of each segment
(1-32), route specifies the incoming routes (these can be multiple)
from other SRs, function is the mode of operation (eg. is it allowed
to cycle, or the fix the probability of an incoming bit), and
interlock is how it deals with incoming SRs which are faster or slower
than itself. These can be imagined as churning, interlocking wheels.

Modes in general are grouped as to functions dealing with route,
function and so on. The first 16 modes on each side are basic in
control, with the first [0. far left] mode always as a default reset
and a simple route in, with configuration of incoming/outgoing signal
codec (top, bottom) or of length (left, right) on the Y knob/CV. The
next 16 modes are more tricky, then we have the 16 strobe modes and
finally, except on the right side, there are 16 recursive modes which
fold back parameters onto each other under CV control. These can be
reset in the last (far right) mode setting. Modes are mostly aligned
across all SRs.

On the last 16 modes of the right side, there are the global modes
which affect global order of execution (which SR runs after which, not
the same as route) routing and recursive parameters. These are reset
in the final (far right turn) mode which also sets and can reset the
global route using the Y parameter. The default route is from top to
left to bottom to right (and back to top if allowed). But each SR can
control its own route in some modes, and can choose when and if it
allows bits in. // 0 mode on RR also resets all

Heavens\ extends the pulse driven shift register schemes of All
Colours with 4 and more interlocking shift registers or "runglers"
(each with 64 modes of operation) running at all different speeds. The
emphasis is on complex CV generation and processing of analogue
signals, as well as clock and pulse outputs. Release date March 2023.

** basic description

how we call SR: as rungler, as a walk-in

Heavens\ presents four interlocking or overlapping shift registers, runglers or digital walk-ins.

Each register has a speed, a mode (of 64) and a length (up to 32 cells) which
can be varied in most cases by control voltage (CV), or by other
parameters. Each has a clock pulse input which, depending on mode
determines speed of the register or some other parameter, such as a
freeze or a strobe.

Each register has 64 modes which can only be selected by the mode
knob. There are 3 major modes which choose how the speed of the
register is determined: by speed CV, by speed CV and another shift
register, or by incoming clock pulses.

The top register is for incoming signals, such as the analogue input
or internal digital noise. Here the mode largely determines the type
of input and how it is processed (eg. how many bits).

The lowest register is for outgoing CV and audio rate signals which
are converted from the digital registers according to various schemes
set by the mode (eg. how many bits).

The left and right registers are used to delay, process and feed back
between top and bottom. The routing of the four distinct registers is
largely fixed as follows (again a few modes can change this fixed
routing). Top register feeds into left which feeds into both lower and
right. The right feeds back in to the top. 

Left and right registers have additional pulse in inputs and two pulse
outs. One of these is half the speed of the other/one division. The
lower register also has two pulses outs giving a total of six pulse
outputs and one analaogue CV/audio out.

All registers can run at differing speeds, the slowest speed is a full
stop which does not advance the register. If a register is running
faster than it's feed-in register it will cycle through a frozen copy
of that register (a ghost) which is updated as soon as the feed-in
runs again. This means that a stopped register will merely repeat its
contents feeding another faster or unstopped register. Some registers
further manipulate their own incoming ghost registers.
