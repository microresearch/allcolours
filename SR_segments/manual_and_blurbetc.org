* notes towards manual/caput draconis

** blurb 2

caput draconis is an ourorack (ouroboric eurorack) module for
gnarlular audio processing, and advanced serpentine all-frequency CV
and audio pattern generation, encoding a series of successively
pleasurable and tortuous sliding dislocations.

Four draconic heavily simulated shift registers are enchained,
interlocked, woven and segmented, recursively and excessively feeding
on each other in turns, vomiting noise and wormy symphonies according
to moon phases and shifting nodal and modal paths. It is to have done
with the judgement of god/s, snaking towards a synthesis without
modules.
 
With sixty-four modes per serpentine section, caput draconis is best
viewed as en-worming more than 16777216 (64^16) unique and complex
instruments, equally invoked and informed by lunar phases and
astrogeomantic time signatures.

theory of operation:

generic: 4 interlocked (software) shift registers, with configurable
routing, speed and length. each has CV control, an adjustable mode,
and clock inputs. Some have pulse inputs. All is bits, 1s and 0s but
analogue signals can be input and can be generated using combinations
of these bits.

hardware in detail:

Each side has 3 knobs and 2 CV inputs, and a clock input. The left and
right sides have a pulse input. The central knob on each side controls
the mode for that SR, the first knob (left to right, up to down) is X,
the third is Y. In the first 32 modes on each side, and other modes
depending on mode, the X control (CV and knob) controls speed. In
modes 33-48 speed is set by the clock input. The clock input is normed
to an artificial, internally generated clock signal. Of course,
inserting a cable here, dissolves this connection. Left and right SRs
both have a pulse input which is simply XORed into the SR; it can be
use to mix new signals into each SR. Left, right and lower SRs each
have two different pulse outputs directly from their own SR bits.

The top SR has an audio input, the bottom SR has an audio
output. Different input and output encodings can be chosen using the
first mode [0] in the case of top and bottom SRs. In some cases on
mode 0 for the top, audio entry SR, internal signals are generated
(noise, oscillation). In the case where no audio signal is plugged in
physically, the output signal from the 2nd output SR is normed to the
input for feedback. Note that feedback can wail or die!

serpent as blackbox:

Each of the four SRs has internally length, speed, incoming route,
function and type of interlock with incoming SRs. Speed can be set and
manipulated by the X (CV/knob) parameter, output from other SRs
(feedback and rungling), or by the clock input depending one of 64
different modes.

Length, route, interlock and function are also set and configured
within the modes. Moving quickly across modes does not result in
setting intermediate values. Length is the length of each segment
(1-32), route specifies the incoming routes (these can be multiple)
from other SRs, function is the mode of operation (eg. is it allowed
to cycle, or the fix the probability of an incoming bit), and
interlock is how it deals with incoming SRs which are faster or slower
than itself. These can be imagined as churning, interlocking wheels.

Modes in general are grouped as to functions dealing with route,
function and so on. The first 16 modes on each side are basic in
control, with the first [0. far left] mode always as a default reset
and a simple route in, with configuration of incoming/outgoing signal
codec (top, bottom) or of length (left, right) on the Y knob/CV. The
next 16 modes are more tricky, then we have the 16 strobe modes and
finally, except on the right side, there are 16 recursive modes which
fold back parameters onto each other under CV control. These can be
reset in the last (far right) mode setting. Modes are mostly aligned
across all SRs.

On the last 16 modes of the right side, there are the global modes
which affect global order of execution (which SR runs after which, not
the same as route) routing and recursive parameters. These are reset
in the final (far right turn) mode which also sets and can reset the
global route using the Y parameter. The default route is from top to
left to bottom to right (and back to top if allowed). But each SR can
control its own route in some modes, and can choose when and if it
allows bits in. // 0 mode on RR also resets all

Input and output settings

Glossary:

[Glossary: SeRpent - shift register]

describe SR as a function 

SR can be described as a serpentine function which eats bits, passes
each bit at clock speed along all its segments, and then excretes that
bit - either to feed on it in a delayed ouroboric cycle or to pass
this bit to another register. It is a form or wormy memory.

Rungler: 

The creation of Rob Hordijk, a rungler is a shift register clocked by
one oscillator and receiving its data input from the other
oscillator. In the recursive cases of CD, the oscillators are any abstract
function or input which can be implemented by an SR.

tips:

- such as use of pulse ins if sections start to run out, also to mix in signals...
- take out clock ins if not being used for strobe speeds or pulses
- operate right hand side at slower speeds or use slow pulsing clock in // not always

work from bottom up - useful configuration on bottom, leave it and start work from top

- use of HF clock signals as strobe clock for CD
- use of comped noise as strobe and as noise/snare entry 
- feedback path with AC
- pulses from CD -> ?

- use of comparator for clocks

hints and tips also: feedback of pulses, what to do when it runs out

use of globals - order of playing

how to play it - consider the combinations of the 4 modes/nodes as an

Heavens\ extends the pulse driven shift register schemes of All
Colours with 4 and more interlocking shift registers or "runglers"
(each with 64 modes of operation) running at all different speeds. The
emphasis is on complex CV generation and processing of analogue
signals, as well as clock and pulse outputs. Release date March 2023.

** basic older description

how we call SR: as rungler, as a walk-in

Heavens\ presents four interlocking or overlapping shift registers, runglers or digital walk-ins.

Each register has a speed, a mode (of 64) and a length (up to 32 cells) which
can be varied in most cases by control voltage (CV), or by other
parameters. Each has a clock pulse input which, depending on mode
determines speed of the register or some other parameter, such as a
freeze or a strobe.

Each register has 64 modes which can only be selected by the mode
knob. There are 3 major modes which choose how the speed of the
register is determined: by speed CV, by speed CV and another shift
register, or by incoming clock pulses.

The top register is for incoming signals, such as the analogue input
or internal digital noise. Here the mode largely determines the type
of input and how it is processed (eg. how many bits).

The lowest register is for outgoing CV and audio rate signals which
are converted from the digital registers according to various schemes
set by the mode (eg. how many bits).

The left and right registers are used to delay, process and feed back
between top and bottom. The routing of the four distinct registers is
largely fixed as follows (again a few modes can change this fixed
routing). Top register feeds into left which feeds into both lower and
right. The right feeds back in to the top. 

Left and right registers have additional pulse in inputs and two pulse
outs. One of these is half the speed of the other/one division. The
lower register also has two pulses outs giving a total of six pulse
outputs and one analaogue CV/audio out.

All registers can run at differing speeds, the slowest speed is a full
stop which does not advance the register. If a register is running
faster than it's feed-in register it will cycle through a frozen copy
of that register (a ghost) which is updated as soon as the feed-in
runs again. This means that a stopped register will merely repeat its
contents feeding another faster or unstopped register. Some registers
further manipulate their own incoming ghost registers.
